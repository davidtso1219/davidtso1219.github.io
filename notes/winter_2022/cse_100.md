## Data Structures (DS) vs. Abstract Data Types (ADT)

| Data Structures | Abstract Data Types |
|:-----:|:-----:|
| Containing data values, relationships among the data, operations applied to the data. | Defined by its behavior from the view of the user: **What operations must it have?** |
| Describes exactly **how the data are organized and how tasks are performed.** | Describes **only what needs to be done** not how its done. |

## Sketching User Flows

- First thing to do is to ask ourselves what we are sketching
- Second thing to do is to define the starting point
- Third thing to do is to define the next step from starting point within the flow
  - What is the next expected step
  - What are the alternatives flow

### Screen Flow

- It could be a sequence of screens or branches of screens
- Make sure we generate ideas for all possible alternatives at any moment
- We can start from the most expected flow and then the alternatives

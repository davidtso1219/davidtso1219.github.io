### Hello, there!

My name is **Hao-Ting Tso**, but I go by **David**. I am new to the world of programming and computer science. I started learning while taking a class at a community college, Foothill College. (Foothill for the win!) I was intrigued about it and I dived into different parts of it. But I did not have a chance to start learning the part of web development. I hope I can use this website to practice my webdev skill as well as to record my journey as becoming a more well-rounded software engineer.
